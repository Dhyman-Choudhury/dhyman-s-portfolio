      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed  dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Hello! I’m <strong>Dhyman</strong>, a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. My programming journey started a few years ago when I was curious about how websites and apps work behind the scenes. From my first “Hello World” to building complex React projects, I’ve enjoyed every step of learning and improving my skills.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed  dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        I especially enjoy working on projects that challenge me to solve problems creatively—whether that’s designing intuitive user interfaces with React or optimizing backend APIs for performance. I’m a big fan of modern JavaScript frameworks and love to keep up with the latest trends and best practices in web development.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed  dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Outside programming, I’m a person who believes balance is key. I enjoy staying active through sports like football and cycling, which help me clear my mind and recharge. I also have a creative side — painting and sketching allow me to express myself and think differently, which often inspires fresh ideas for my coding projects.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed  dark:text-gray-300">
        Overall, I’m someone who’s curious, driven, and always eager to learn new things. I believe programming is not just a career but a continuous journey of growth and discovery, and I’m excited about what the future holds!
